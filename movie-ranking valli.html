    was so amaing. 10/10.

<p>One of the best releases OKAY. the cast was on point, aesthetic, the story 
    I love it all .I was shaking , crying , sobbing, throwing up when the scene of him being deaf came up.
    I could not bear it. He did not deserve that at all. I wish they showed seolrina at the end too but oh well i love it.

<p>My top anime picks for the past 2 months. Ofcurse watching it with bro was extra enjoyable, the way we were trying
    to connect the dots, discuss about the probable future plot, it was all fun. The ost slaps hard. I enjoyed pune.
